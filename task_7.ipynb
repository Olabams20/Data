    "Task 1: Class Test Scores\n",
    "Scores: 5, 8, 10, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 18, 18, 20, 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Total = 5 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 18 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 227\n",

    "\n",
    "If the lowest score (5) was wrongly recorded and should have been 10:\n",
    "New total = 227 - 5 + 10 = 232 New mean = 232 / 15 = 15.47 (approx) Median remains 14 middle value unchanged Mode remains 12 still most frequent\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean increases because the total sum increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median and mode are unaffected since the change doesn’t alter the middle value or the frequency of the most common score.\n",

    "Most frequent values:\n",
    "\n",
    "20 and 25 both appear twice Mode = 20 & 25\n",

    "Median is the best representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is skewed by the extreme value (120 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The median (25 minutes) better reflects the central tendency of most students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode is useful but less representative here due to dual peaks.\n",
